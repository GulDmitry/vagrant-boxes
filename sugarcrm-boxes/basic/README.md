## Basic box for SugarCRM

## Box
* Ubuntu 13.04 32.

## Requirements
* Apache 2.2
* PHP 5.4
* xDebug
* MySQL 5.5
* ElasticSearch 0.9.x

## Tips
* Mysq user `root` pswd `root` db `sugarcrm` 

## TODO
* Waiting until RSYNC become two-way. The "vagrant-rsync-back" can be used to sync from guest to host but
in pair with "rsync-auto" it makes developing process uncomfortable.
